## Notes

- This specification for "Phase 2: User Authentication" includes significant technical and implementation details (e.g., specific frameworks, API endpoints, database schema, component names) as explicitly provided by the user. This is an intentional deviation from general guidelines for feature specifications, as it defines the technical blueprint for the authentication system.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
