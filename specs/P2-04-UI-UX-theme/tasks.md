# Tasks: Phase 4: UI/UX Overhaul

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/P2-04-ui-ux-theme/`
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md` (required), `spec.md` (required for user stories), `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/README.md`, `quickstart.md`

**Tests**: Test tasks are included as verification steps within each user story's implementation, rather than separate TDD test-first tasks, as not explicitly requested.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Paths assume a monorepo structure with `frontend/` and `backend/` directories.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Initial project setup for the UI/UX overhaul, ensuring all necessary foundational libraries and configurations are in place.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-   **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately.
-   **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion. BLOCKS all user stories.
-   **User Stories (Phases 3, 4, 5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion.
    -   User Stories 1 and 2 (P1) can proceed in parallel.
    -   User Story 3 (P2) can proceed after Foundational, ideally after P1 stories are well underway or complete.
-   **Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being substantially complete.

### User Story Dependencies

-   **User Story 1 (P1 - Impressive Landing Page)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2). No direct dependencies on other user stories for its core functionality.
-   **User Story 2 (P1 - Enjoyable Dashboard Experience)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2). No direct dependencies on other user stories for its core functionality.
-   **User Story 3 (P2 - Smooth Navigation Experience)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2). Integrates new pages, so it might benefit from basic styling and component readiness from earlier phases.

### Within Each User Story

-   Core component creation/integration before specific page implementations.
-   Visual implementation before verification steps.

### Parallel Opportunities

-   All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel.
-   All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2).
-   Once the Foundational phase completes, User Story 1 (Phase 3) and User Story 2 (Phase 4) can be worked on in parallel by different team members due to their P1 priority and relative independence.
-   Within user stories, tasks marked [P] (e.g., creating multiple UI components) can run in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Setup
2.  Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3.  Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently against its acceptance criteria.
5.  Deploy/demo if ready for a very early preview.

### Incremental Delivery

1.  Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready.
2.  Add User Story 1 (Landing Page) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (early MVP).
3.  Add User Story 2 (Dashboard) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo.
4.  Add User Story 3 (New Pages & Navigation) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo.
5.  Each story adds significant user value without breaking previously implemented stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1.  The team completes Setup + Foundational phases together or by designated infrastructure/core developers.
2.  Once Foundational is done:
    *   Developer A: Focuses on User Story 1 (Landing Page).
    *   Developer B: Focuses on User Story 2 (Dashboard Experience).
    *   Developer C: Focuses on User Story 3 (New Pages & Navigation).
3.  All developers contribute to the final Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns phase.

## Notes

-   [P] tasks = different files, minimal immediate dependencies, suitable for parallel execution.
-   [Story] label maps task to a specific user story for traceability and independent development.
-   Each user story should be independently completable and testable.
-   Verification tasks are manual checks against acceptance criteria.
-   Commit after each task or logical group of related tasks.
-   Stop at any checkpoint to validate the completed story independently.
-   Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts (where possible for [P] tasks), cross-story dependencies that break independence.
