You are a senior Next.js frontend engineer. Your task is to IMPLEMENT (not design conceptually) a complete landing page UI using Next.js 14 App Router and Tailwind CSS only. Do NOT skip any detail. The tech stack must strictly follow these rules: Framework must be Next.js using the App Router. Styling must be done using Tailwind CSS only. No external UI libraries are allowed. Do not use inline CSS. Do not use CSS files. Use only Tailwind utility classes. The folder structure is mandatory and must be followed exactly. Inside the /app directory, create page.tsx for the Landing Page, /login/page.tsx for the Login Page, and /signup/page.tsx for the Signup Page. Inside a /components directory, create LandingCard.tsx and BackgroundGlow.tsx. Global styling rules are as follows: the background must be full viewport height using min-h-screen, the page must be centered using flex, the theme must be dark only, and text must be readable with sufficient contrast. For the background design, create a full-screen dark background with a base color of pure black (#000000). Add two blurred gradient glow elements using absolute positioning: one teal/green glow on the left bottom and one teal/green glow on the right top. Use Tailwind gradients and blur utilities with opacity between 20–30% and blur-xl or blur-2xl. The background must not scroll. Create a centered glassmorphism card with desktop width max-w-md and mobile width w-[90%]. The card background must be bg-white/10 with backdrop-blur-lg, a border using border border-white/20, rounded corners using rounded-2xl, a shadow-2xl, padding px-8 py-10, and text aligned center. The card content must be arranged from top to bottom. First, an icon: a square outline icon with a checkmark inside, color text-emerald-400, size h-12 w-12, centered, with margin bottom mb-6. Second, the title with text “Todo App”, font size text-3xl, font weight font-bold, color text-white, and margin bottom mb-3. Third, a two-line description paragraph with the exact text “Organize your tasks efficiently and boost your productivity. Simple, powerful, and beautifully designed task management.” The description must be text-gray-300, center aligned, text-sm, leading-relaxed, with margin bottom mb-8. Fourth, a buttons container using flex row layout with gap-4. The Login button is the primary button with text “Login”, width flex-1, height h-11, background bg-emerald-400, text color text-black, rounded rounded-md, font weight font-semibold, hover effects hover:bg-emerald-300 and hover:shadow-lg, and transition transition-all duration-200. On click, it must navigate to /login using Next.js useRouter. The Sign Up button is the secondary button with text “Sign Up”, width flex-1, height h-11, background bg-gray-700, text color text-white, rounded rounded-md, font weight font-medium, hover effect hover:bg-gray-600, and transition transition-all duration-200. On click, it must navigate to /signup. The Login page UI must have the same dark background as the landing page, a centered card, title “Login”, an email input, a password input, and a submit button. Inputs must use bg-black/40, border border-white/20, and text-white. The submit button color must be emerald. The Signup page UI must use the same layout as the login page with fields for Name, Email, and Password, and the button text must be “Create Account”. Responsiveness rules are mobile-first, the card must always remain centered, and there must be no overflow issues. Important rules: the code must compile, use "use client" where required, use functional components only, use useRouter from next/navigation, and return full implementation code, not explanation.
