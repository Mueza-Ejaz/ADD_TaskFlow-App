# Tasks: Task CRUD Operations

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/P2-03-crud-operations/`
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md` (required), `spec.md` (required for user stories)

**Tests**: The feature specification indicates backend and frontend testing requirements, so test tasks will be included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

-   **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
-   **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
-   Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

-   **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure. Although the feature directory is set up, these tasks ensure proper project configuration.

-   [x] T001 Configure backend environment if needed (e.g., install dependencies if not already done)
-   [x] T002 Configure frontend environment if needed (e.g., install dependencies if not already done)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented. This aligns with Phase 3A: Backend Foundation from `plan.md`.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

### Implementation for Foundational Tasks

-   [x] T003 [P] Update database schema for `Task` entity in `backend/src/models/task.py` (add `user_id`, `priority`, `due_date`, `status` columns).
-   [x] T004 [P] Create Pydantic schema for `Task` and `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` in `backend/src/schemas/task.py`.
-   [x] T005 [P] Implement base `Task` service layer for database interactions in `backend/src/services/task_service.py`.
-   [x] T006 [P] Configure FastAPI router for tasks under `/api/v1/tasks` in `backend/src/api/v1/endpoints/tasks.py`.
-   [x] T007 Implement middleware for user-specific task isolation in `backend/src/core/middleware.py` (if not already handled by JWT).
-   [x] T008 Implement basic unit tests for `Task` model and schemas in `backend/tests/test_task_models.py`.
-   [x] T009 Implement basic unit tests for `Task` service layer in `backend/tests/test_task_service.py`.

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-   **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
-   **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
-   **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
    -   P1 user stories can proceed in parallel once Foundational is complete.
    -   P2 user stories can proceed in parallel once Foundational is complete.
-   **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

-   **User Story 1 (P1 - Create Task)**: Independent after Foundational.
-   **User Story 2 (P1 - View Tasks Dashboard)**: Independent after Foundational.
-   **User Story 4 (P1 - Update Task)**: Independent after Foundational.
-   **User Story 6 (P1 - Toggle Task Status)**: Independent after Foundational.
-   **User Story 3 (P2 - Filter, Sort, Search Tasks)**: Independent after Foundational, but benefits from US2 for context.
-   **User Story 5 (P2 - Delete Task)**: Independent after Foundational, but benefits from US2 for context.

### Within Each User Story

-   Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation.
-   Models/Schemas before services.
-   Services before API endpoints.
-   Frontend UI components before integration with data.
-   Story complete before moving to next priority (if working sequentially).

### Parallel Opportunities

-   All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their respective phases.
-   Once the Foundational phase completes, all P1 user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members.
-   Once P1 user stories are complete, P2 user stories can be worked on in parallel.
-   Within each user story phase, test tasks can be done in parallel with other test tasks, and UI components can be done in parallel with API/service implementations (given clear contracts).

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Create Task)

```bash
# Frontend Tasks:
- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Write frontend unit tests for `TaskForm` component in `frontend/components/TaskForm.test.tsx`.
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Write frontend integration tests for create task flow in `frontend/tests/integration/create_task.test.tsx`.
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create `TaskForm` React component in `frontend/components/TaskForm.tsx` (using React Hook Form and Zod).
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Implement generic `Modal` UI component in `frontend/components/ui/Modal.tsx`.

# Backend Tasks:
- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Write backend integration tests for `POST /api/v1/tasks` endpoint in `backend/tests/test_task_api.py`.
- [ ] T016 [US1] Implement `POST /api/v1/tasks` endpoint in `backend/src/api/v1/endpoints/tasks.py` to create tasks with user_id.

# Integration (after above are done):
- [ ] T015 [US1] Integrate `TaskForm` into a modal for task creation in `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`.
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add React Query mutation for creating tasks with optimistic updates in `frontend/hooks/useTasks.ts`.
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 User Stories Only)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Setup
2.  Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3.  Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Create Task)
4.  Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (View Tasks Dashboard)
5.  Complete Phase 5: User Story 4 (Update Task)
6.  Complete Phase 6: User Story 6 (Toggle Task Status)
7.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 user stories independently and together.
8.  Deploy/demo if ready.

### Incremental Delivery

1.  Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2.  Add User Story 1 (Create Task) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Basic MVP)
3.  Add User Story 2 (View Tasks Dashboard) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4.  Add User Story 4 (Update Task) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5.  Add User Story 6 (Toggle Task Status) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6.  Add User Story 3 (Filter, Sort, Search Tasks) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7.  Add User Story 5 (Delete Task) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
8.  Complete Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1.  Team completes Setup + Foundational together.
2.  Once Foundational is done:
    -   Developer A: User Story 1 (Create Task)
    -   Developer B: User Story 2 (View Tasks Dashboard)
    -   Developer C: User Story 4 (Update Task)
    -   Developer D: User Story 6 (Toggle Task Status)
3.  Once P1 stories are complete:
    -   Developer E: User Story 3 (Filter, Sort, Search Tasks)
    -   Developer F: User Story 5 (Delete Task)
4.  Team collaborates on Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns.

## Notes

-   [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
-   [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
-   Each user story should be independently completable and testable
-   Verify tests fail before implementing
-   Commit after each task or logical group
-   Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
-   Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
