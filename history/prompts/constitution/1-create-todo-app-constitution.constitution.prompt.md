## Prompt

Create a comprehensive Constitution file for the entire project. The Constitution should establish IMMUTABLE standards that apply to ALL features and components.

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created a comprehensive constitution file for your Todo Full-Stack Web Application at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. The constitution includes all 10 required sections with testable and specific rules:

1. Core Principles
2. Code Quality Standards (Frontend and Backend)
3. Testing Requirements (Frontend, Backend, and E2E)
4. Security Standards (Authentication, Data Protection, API Security)
5. UI/UX Standards (Design Principles and User Experience)
6. Database Standards (Database Design and Data Management)
7. Git Workflow (Branching Strategy and Code Review Process)
8. Documentation Requirements (Project and Code Documentation)
9. Development Workflow (Spec-Kit Plus Process and Feature Development)
10. Performance Standards (Frontend and Backend)

All rules are specific and testable rather than vague, and the governance section includes proper versioning information. The constitution follows proper markdown format with clear sections.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive project constitution establishing immutable standards
- 🧪 Tests: 
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md created with all required sections
- 🔁 Next prompts: Build Specification
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution provides a solid foundation for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application with clear, testable standards for all team members to follow.
