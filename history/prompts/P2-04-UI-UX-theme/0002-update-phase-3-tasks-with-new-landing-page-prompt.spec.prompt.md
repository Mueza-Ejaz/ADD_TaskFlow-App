# Prompt
jo me apko text de rahi hooo is task ko bhi ap task.md file me include karooo yani jab ap implementation karo to ye bhi task karooo ===You are a senior Next.js frontend engineer. Your task is to IMPLEMENT (not design conceptually) a complete landing page UI using Next.js 14 App Router and Tailwind CSS only. [truncated for brevity]

# Response
I have updated `specs/P2-04-UI-UX-theme/tasks.md` to replace the previous "User Story 1" tasks with the specific instructions you provided.
I also saved the full prompt text to `specs/P2-04-UI-UX-theme/landing-page-prompt.md` for reference during implementation.

The tasks now explicitly require implementing the Landing, Login, and Signup pages according to your "Senior Frontend Engineer" directive.
