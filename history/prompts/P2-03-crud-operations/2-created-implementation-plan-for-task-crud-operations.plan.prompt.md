command: /sp.plan Create implementation plan for Phase 3 based on specs/phase-3-task-crud/spec.md. Save to: specs/phase-3-task-crud/plan.md. Output must be in markdown format with following structure: # Phase 3: Task CRUD Operations - Implementation Plan. Branch: phase-3-task-crud. Date: {current_date}. Spec Reference: specs/phase-3-task-crud/spec.md. Prerequisite: Phase 2 authentication complete. ## 1. Architecture Decisions. ### Decision 1: State Management. Choice: React Query + React Context. Why: Built-in caching, optimistic updates. ### Decision 2: Form Management. Choice: React Hook Form + Zod. Why: Performance, type-safe validation. ### Decision 3: Drag & Drop. Choice: @dnd-kit. Why: Lightweight, mobile touch support. ## 2. Implementation Phases (5 Days). ### Phase 3A: Backend Foundation (Day 1). Tasks: 1. Database Migration (2 hours). 2. Task Service Layer (2.5 hours). 3. API Endpoints (3 hours). 4. Testing (1.5 hours). Deliverables: - Updated tasks table with new columns. - Complete task service with user isolation. - All 7 API endpoints working. - Test suite with 90% coverage. ### Phase 3B: Frontend Dashboard (Day 2). Tasks: 1. Dashboard Layout (2 hours). 2. Task Display Components (3 hours). 3. React Query Setup (2 hours). 4. Data Integration (1 hour). Deliverables: - Complete dashboard page. - Task kanban and list views. - React Query with caching. - Loading/empty states. ### Phase 3C: Task Creation & Editing (Day 3). Tasks: 1. TaskForm Component (2.5 hours). 2. Modal System (1.5 hours). 3. Create Task Flow (2 hours). 4. Edit Task Flow (2 hours). Deliverables: - Reusable TaskForm with validation. - Modal system for forms. - Complete create/edit workflows. - Optimistic updates. ### Phase 3D: Advanced Features (Day 4). Tasks: 1. Filter & Sort System (2.5 hours). 2. Drag & Drop (2 hours). 3. Task Actions (2 hours). 4. Responsive Optimization (1.5 hours). Deliverables: - Complete filtering/sorting/search. - Drag & drop with animations. - Delete/complete/bulk actions. - Mobile-responsive design. ### Phase 3E: Polish & Testing (Day 5). Tasks: 1. Animations (2 hours). 2. Error Handling (2 hours). 3. Testing Suite (3 hours). 4. Performance Optimization (1 hour). Deliverables: - Smooth animations. - Robust error handling. - Comprehensive tests. - Performance optimized. ## 3. Technical Specifications. ### File Structure: backend/src/ ├── models/task.py. ├── services/task_service.py. ├── api/v1/endpoints/tasks.py. └── schemas/task.py. frontend/ ├── app/dashboard/. ├── components/ui/. ├── hooks/. └── lib/. ### Dependencies: bash npm install @tanstack/react-query react-hook-form zod @dnd-kit/core date-fns Environment Variables: No new variables needed. 4. Integration Points. With Phase 2: JWT tokens automatically included. User context available. Protected routes pattern established. With Phase 1: Use existing design components. Apply consistent spacing/typography. Follow color palette. 5. Risk Mitigation. Risk 1: Data Isolation Bugs. Mitigation: Comprehensive backend tests for user filtering. Risk 2: Drag & Drop Performance. Mitigation: Virtualize large lists, use CSS transforms. Risk 3: Mobile Touch Issues. Mitigation: Thorough mobile testing, touch-friendly components. 6. Success Metrics Validation. Daily Checkpoints: Day 1: Backend endpoints working, tests passing. Day 2: Dashboard loads tasks, basic UI complete. Day 3: Task creation/editing works end-to-end. Day 4: Filters, sort, drag & drop functional. Day 5: Animations smooth, tests comprehensive. Final Validation: All user stories implemented. Performance targets met. Security requirements satisfied. Mobile responsive. Accessibility compliant. 7. Handoff to Phase 4. Completed Foundation: Task CRUD fully functional. User data isolation implemented. Responsive, animated UI. Comprehensive test coverage. Next Phase (Phase 4): Will build on this with: Task categories/tags. File attachments.

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated the implementation plan for "Phase 3: Task CRUD Operations" at `specs/P2-03-crud-operations/plan.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Plan created.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run for plan creation.
- 📁 Files: Created plan file.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `sp.tasks`
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully generated implementation plan despite environment variable inheritance issues.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `setup-plan.ps1` not correctly inheriting `SPECIFY_FEATURE` environment variable.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate robust environment variable passing for PowerShell scripts or modify scripts to accept direct arguments.
