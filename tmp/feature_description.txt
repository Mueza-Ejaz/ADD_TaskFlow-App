You are a Senior Product Manager creating specifications for TaskFlow Pro - a modern Todo application. The current status is: Phase 1: Complete (Project foundation, monorepo setup, database connection), Phase 2: Complete (User authentication with Better Auth + JWT, signup/login working), and Phase 3: Task CRUD Operations (This phase - core functionality). The tech stack includes Frontend: Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS; Backend: FastAPI, SQLModel, Python 3.12+; Database: Neon PostgreSQL (Serverless); Authentication: Better Auth + JWT (already implemented in Phase 2); State Management: React Query, React Context. The specification output file will be created at specs/P3-03-Crud operations/spec.md. The specification requirements include core functionality: Implement complete Task CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with user-specific task isolation (each user sees only their tasks), rich task attributes (title, description, priority, due date, status), interactive UI with drag & drop between columns, real-time updates and smooth animations, filtering, sorting, and search capabilities, responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop. User stories must be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound), including Story 1: Create Task, Story 2: View Tasks Dashboard, Story 3: Filter and Sort Tasks, Story 4: Update Task, Story 5: Delete Task, and Story 6: Toggle Task Status, each with detailed acceptance criteria. Technical specifications include Backend API Endpoints (all require JWT authentication) such as GET /api/v1/tasks, GET /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}, POST /api/v1/tasks, PUT /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}, PATCH /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/complete, DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}, GET /api/v1/tasks/summary, Database Schema Updates with SQL examples, Frontend Components required (TaskDashboard, TaskKanban, TaskList, TaskCard, TaskForm, TaskFilters, TaskSummary, EmptyState, ConfirmationModal, Toast), State Management Strategy (Server State: React Query, UI State: React Context, Form State: React Hook Form with Zod validation, Cache Strategy: Stale-while-revalidate with optimistic updates). UI/UX requirements include design system integration, priority colors (High (#ef4444), Medium (#f59e0b), Low (#10b981)), consistent spacing, typography hierarchy, animations & transitions (task creation, deletion, status change, modal, drag & drop), responsive breakpoints (mobile <640px, tablet 640–1024px, desktop >1024px), accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, focus management, color contrast ratio >4.5:1). Security requirements cover data isolation (all queries with WHERE user_id = current_user.id, API middleware validates JWT), input validation (backend: Pydantic models, frontend: form validation, SQL injection prevention), rate limiting (task creation: 10 requests/minute, API calls: 60 requests/minute). Performance requirements include API performance (task list load <300ms, task operations <200ms, initial dashboard load <2 seconds), frontend optimization (code splitting, virtual scrolling, image optimization ready, bundle size monitoring). Testing requirements cover backend tests (unit, integration, security tests, 90%+ coverage), frontend tests (component, integration, E2E tests, 80%+ coverage), critical paths (login → create task → complete task → delete 100%). Error handling includes user-friendly errors (form validation inline, API errors as toast, network errors with retry, 404 task not found), error scenarios covered (task not found, unauthorized access, DB issues, invalid input, rate limit exceeded). Success validation checklist includes functional validation (task creation, correct columns, filters & sorts, editing, deletion, status toggle, data persistence), security validation (user isolation, JWT required, no sensitive data exposed), performance validation (dashboard <2s, task ops <300ms, smooth animations), UX validation (mobile responsive, keyboard accessible, clear error messages, intuitive interface). Integration with existing system includes Phase 2 Authentication (all task API calls include JWT, user context for task ownership, protected routes), Phase 1 Design System (existing Button, Input, Card components, consistent spacing, typography, color palette).
