### **4. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

#### **Frontend Updates:**
1. **Install Framer Motion:**
```bash
npm install framer-motion

2. Create Animation Components:
- AnimatedBackground - Mesh gradient with particles
- GlassCard - Reusable glassmorphism card
- AnimatedButton - Button with hover effects
- PageTransition - Page transition wrapper

3. Update Existing Components:
- Add glassmorphism styles to all cards
- Add hover animations to buttons
- Update modals with backdrop blur
- Add page transition animations

New Components to Create:
- GlassCard - Reusable glassmorphism component
- AnimatedBackground - Gradient background with particles
- FloatingActionButton - Animated FAB
- PageTransition - Smooth page transitions
- ParticleEffect - Background particles animation
- HoverCard - Card with hover effects

Performance Considerations:
- Optimize gradient animations for performance
- Use CSS transforms for smooth animations
- Implement loading states for background effects
- Test on mobile devices for performance

5. USER STORIES:
Story 1: First-time User Experience
"As a new user, I want to be impressed by the landing page design so I feel motivated to sign up."

Acceptance Criteria:
- Landing page has animated gradient background

- All animations run at 60fps
- Mobile performance score > 90 (Lighthouse)
- User satisfaction rating improvement

7. INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEM:
With Phase 3: Keep all functionality, just update styling
With Phase 2: Authentication flow remains same, UI updated
With Phase 1: Design system builds on existing foundation

SPECIFICATION FILE FORMATTING:
- Use proper markdown with headers
- Include design mockup descriptions
- Add technical implementation details
- Reference existing components to update
